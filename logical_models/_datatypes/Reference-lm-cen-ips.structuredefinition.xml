	<description value="A “reference” pattern is a means to provide a directional link from a source element to a target. References can be internal, i.e. they refer to information included in the patient summary; or external, i.e. they refer to objects found elsewhere.
Depending on the technology used and on the type of object referenced, different types of information may be requested, e.g. just an URL (literal reference); just an identifier (logical reference); a set of identifiers; a set of identifiers plus other information needed to access the object; and so on. An example is in the Advance Directive Section which may need a link to an external legal document."/>
