	<description value="In this domain, ‘ratio’ is used in a very broad sense as in ISO 21090.  A quantity constructed as the quotient of a numerator quantity divided by a denominator quantity.
“Ratios are different from rational numbers, i.e. in ratios common factors in the numerator and denominator never cancel out.
The Ratio datatype supports titre (e.g. “1:128”) and other quantities produced by laboratories that truly represent ratios. Ratios are not simply “structured numerics”, particularly blood pressure measurements (e.g. “120/60”) are not ratios.  See also note 1 RTO (ratio) description” [ISO 21090:2011] 

A Ratio may be used for example for indicating medicine strengths (e.g. 100 mg / 100 ml) where, 100 mg is the numerator quantity and 100 ml is the denominator quantity. (not just a rational number)"/>
