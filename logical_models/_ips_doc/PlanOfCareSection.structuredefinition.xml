			<definition value="Dynamic, personalized plan including identified needed healthcare activity, health objectives and healthcare goals, relating to one or more specified health issues in a healthcare process. [EN ISO 13940]. Notes:  A care plan is a complex document in its own right as the definition makes clear.  However, there is no consensus on how such a plan should be constructed.  The HL7 DAM Care Plan extends the purpose given above, by adding “the [lifetime] condition of the patient with goals of educating the patient on how to reduce the modifiable risks of the patient’s genetic, behavioural, and environmental pre-conditions and otherwise optimizing lifetime outcomes. This level of detail seems to go beyond what a Patient Summary for unplanned care could be expected to deliver, but the requirement is also to serve planned care.  The eHN Guideline limits plan activities to recommendations.  That having been said, there is clear merit for incorporating such information if requested.  This standard follows the same convention used in the Advance Directives IPS Section and provides the opportunity of referencing an existing external document, treating the Recommendations as the core of a reusable care plan."/>
